### Python scripts
🐍 Circularity.py -- This script calculates the circularity of craters\
🐍Graph_dtoD.py -- This script generates graphs showing d/D versus diameter with uncertainties\
🐍Maximum_search.py -- This script finds the altitude maxima for each profile every 10°\
🐍Slopes.py -- This script finds crater slopes\
🐍TRI.py -- This script calculates the TRI index and saves it as an image\
🐍Topographical_profiles.py -- This script draws profiles every 10° and the average crater profile\
🐍calculs_5m.py -- This script is used to process the craters by calling the preceding scripts
